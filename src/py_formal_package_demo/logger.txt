formal python package solution 

this project is a intermedia project for the python module called by dll . 
what i need to do make a break through the python calling  , and summary a 
mature and stable solution for python embed into the c++ , and provide assistant 
for current projcet 



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// logger 
1	it is weird that the python embed always throw unknow exception . that 
	make me confused ,for i had no idea where the hell execpetion come from . 
	i had two option for the situation test 
	1	add the _ONE_SOLUTION_
	2	CHANGE INTO THE FFPTYHON HEAD FILE to find what had change 
	
2	it is really weird , the software could not call the python interpretor 
	anymore , and i don't know what had happen . everything are in control 
	the base option seems have some issue . 
	
3	when the python interpretor was release ,it will print something on the 
	console screen . which is out of my expectation . it would not hurt 
	but what i did not find out what had change to make the software could run 
	agian . 
	
4	the reason that the c++ compile throw errror is for it could find the pyc
	file , but if the assuption is aproved , what should it do for the file 
	that could not generate the such a file 
	assuption :
	i should delte the file to test what would happen 
	
5	the problem cause the python module could not be load is for the module name 
	the ffpython could not accept the name test . i should be cautious about the 
	python module names . now i think it is time to get back 
	
6	 i should test the route , where it will accept the ms path 
	the path function is really compatible with the path . i think i will have to 
	stop the python feature , to finish the base option 
	
7	in the ffpython , it not support enter the string directly ,it only suppurt 
	the variant enter . at the same time , i think  i should build up de addredd 
	enter precause mechanism . if the address is incorrect , i hope there will 
	have some hint for me 
	for the paht precaution mechanism what i could do is remind the user 
	the folder is not found , please check the enter path whether it is correct 
	
8	the software could do the base option , but i should add the default file ext 
	
9	for the pyzipfile dealling method , i think i should abstract the , i think i 
	add the copy python27.dll to the speciafy  folder . and for the speciafy folder 
	i think when the c++ folder call it , i think i should get the current dir
	for test 
	
10	time for find the and modify the strpath. i reason i wanna take used try 
	and exception is for i wanna located the error place , and find out 
	what error had occur like in the python , when i run the python , i will 
	fast find the error place , 
	the excpetion is more genece , i could deal with it ,or i could abort and throw 
	where the software error , what kind error had happen . that is the key to 
	code . if i just take the if condition to deal with exception , 
	the code although i could abort the software , but it is rough , and 
	really not friedly for me .
	
11	so , tomorrow work , i will finish the last work of centrecontrol , and 
	then i will need to learn how to used the python exception , how to get the 
	grace code stytle in the morning , . then at the afternoon , i will begin my 
	python thread learn . 
	
12	now time for get back python , what i need to do is to dig out . some of python 
	data seems have lost , which module is for the pytho27.dll copy 
	
13	i think it is not the time for the python base 

14	the first thing i think i should strict keep the rule , that monday and friday i 
	should leave the work office , go to the rest room to do some homework , that 
	would make my emotion more easy and comfortable . 
	what is more , this is a great step to delcare war at the overwork 
	i would not overwork endless . and i don't wanna be monitored . that is 
	is holy key to make thing 
	
	
15	the best method to call the module form other language , i think i should 
	leave a mark function for test . 
	
16	before i continue the job , i think i should sort of the files 

17	so the target would be how to use a class interface to call the python function 
	i need package all the interface , so that the work would be easy for me 
	
18	as the dll export project was append , this project i will have to stop it 
	the first thing i think i should apply my current technique on the project , so 
	that the technique would make some process 
	
19	what i know is that , the dll calling operation would cost too much , what 
	i need is to make sure the technique would make my work more easy and efficiency 
	so , i dont wanna give more time on the dll calling python . however , as 
	i had invest so much time on it , i should not give up so easy without any 
	try . at least , take a try , to make sure it would work
